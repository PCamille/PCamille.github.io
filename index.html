            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Camille Priou</strong>.</p>
            <p>I'm a <strong>back-end developer</strong> specialized in <strong>C#</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <h3>ING - September 2018-Now</h3>
            <h4>Back-end developer</h4>
            <p>
                I'm in charge of the back-end development for internal applications.
                The back-end is built with ASP.NET Core, the relation with the MS SQL database is managed with Entity-framework.
                The applications are developed to respect ACPR (French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority) rules after a report made by them. That implies a great attention on application security and data integrity and a short delay to deploy a viable solution.
            </p>
            <h5>Developed application</h5>
            <h6>KYC Workflow</h6>
            <p>
                The KYC Workflow (KYC for "Know Your Customers") is an application made to ensure that a customer provide all the correct mandatory documents inorder to open a bank account, and that old customer keep their documents updated.
            </p>
            <h4>Robotic developer</h4>
            <p>
                The mission of the robotic teams was to develop robots to secure and simplify the daily life work of employees.
                We developed two type of robots, the first one just take control of an employee computer (or run on a dedicated virtual machine) to realise basic action instead of the human, and the second one has an interface where the user can access data from multiple sources and trigger automatic actions one multiple applications too.
                A robot has the advantage to be quicker and safer than a human by avoiding careless error.
                One of the major advantage of a robot is that it manipulates application by interact with interfaces designed for human and so you can ignore some security questions because it's already managed by the manipulated application.
                You can also automate application which doesn't provide API for example, the 'Banque de France' website.
            </p>
            <h4>Scrum master</h4>
            <p>In parallel of my mission as developer, I assume the role of scrum master inside my agile team. My role is, among other things, to ensure that all scrum events (stand-up, sprint planning, etc.) take place and are productive. As the youngest person in the team, it is a challenge to make my voice heard and respected.</p>
