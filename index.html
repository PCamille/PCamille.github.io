            <h4>Back-end developer</h4>

            <h4>Robotic developer</h4>
            <p>
                The mission of the robotic teams was to develop robots to secure and simplify the daily life work of employees.
                We developed two type of robots, the first one just take control of a employee computer (or run on a dedicated virtual machine) to realise basic action instead of the human, and the second one has a interface where the user can acces data from multiple sources and trigger automatic actions one multiple applications too.
                A robot has the advantage to be quicker and safer than a human by avoiding careless error.
                One of the major advantage of a robot is that it manipulates application by interact with interfaces designed for human and so you can ignore some security questions cause it'a already managed by the manipulated application.
                You can also automate application which doesn't provide API for example, the 'Banque de France' website.
